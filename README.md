# WaterSurfaceLevelSensing
CSE237A WI23 Project. Using Infineon BGT60TR13C and underwater speaker to communicate 0 and 1s

System:
Windows 10

Hardware:
Infineon BGT60TR13C
Under water bluetooth speaker.


How to use:
Use the radar to collect 20 seconds of data.
In between the 20 seconds, start playing a custom 100 hz audio file.
The speaker under water will generate waves on the water surface.

The radar's resulting amplitude will be higher in variance as shown in the given test.ipynb file using sample data data13.npz
